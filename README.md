# File Combiner

This is a small React app that helps you combine multiple files into a single text. Perfect if you’ve run into file or attachment limits when pasting code/text into Claude or GPT.

## Features

- Drag & drop multiple files (TXT, JS, TS, JSON, CSS, MD, etc.)
- Each file gets labeled with its name (`// filename.js`)
- Edit combined content before copying
- One-click "Copy All" to clipboard
- Clear everything in one go
- Built with React + Chakra UI

---

## How it Works

1. Drop your files on the left panel
2. They’ll be merged into one text block on the right
3. Copy all content with a single click
4. Paste into Claude/GPT without worrying about upload limits
